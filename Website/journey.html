                                <p>The final deliverable for your course project on which you’ll be graded is your final project website, not the engineering system itself. Your project’s website should capture and document the work you’ve done on your project to make it a success on demo day. One way to think about the final website is that someone coming to your site with your skills should reasonably be able to reproduce your work. Another way to think about your website is to put yourself in the position of a future PoE student looking for inspiration - would you find the website helpful? Inspiring? <br/><br/>
                                Your final project website should accomplish these two objectives:<br/>
                                Thoroughly document your project - design, technical, and appropriate process work.<br/>
                                Develop media that is suitably polished to represent your finished work publicly on the web.
